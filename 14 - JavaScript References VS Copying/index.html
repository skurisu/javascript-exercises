    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;

    console.log(age, age2); // reference will not be updated

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team and players = ['Wes','Sarah','Ryan','Lux']
    // the reference will update the array
    
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // will return entire array
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'something else';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Toni K',
      age: 14
    }

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100}) // pass new object, object that you want to take properties from, add properties you wish to overwrite/add
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
